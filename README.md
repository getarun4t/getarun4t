ðŸ”§ **Embedded Software Developer | C++ | SDV | Robotics | Automotive | Python**

Iâ€™m an Embedded Software Developer with 11+ years of experience, currently working on **Software Defined Vehicle (SDV)** features for the **Porsche PPE Platform**. My core expertise lies in **C++**, **Python**, **ROS 2**, and **Adaptive AUTOSAR**, with a strong passion for Robotics and Embedded Systems.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve contributed across the full software lifecycle â€” from development and testing to integration â€” and have built CI/CD pipelines and scalable automation frameworks to ensure robust and maintainable systems.

Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge in **Autonomous Driving**, **Robotics**, **Embedded AI**, and next-generation SDV architectures â€” always eager to explore innovations at the intersection of software and machines.
