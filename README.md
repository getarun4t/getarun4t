ðŸ”§ Embedded Software Developer | C++ | ROS 2 | SDV | Robotics | Python | Automotive

I am an Embedded Software Developer with 11+ years of experience, currently working on Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) features for the Porsche PPE Platform. My strengths lie in Modern C++, Python, ROS 2, and Adaptive AUTOSAR, with deep experience in ECU development and embedded automotive systems.

ðŸ’¡ Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed across the entire software lifecycle â€” from development and testing to integration â€” building CI/CD pipelines, automation frameworks, and safety-compliant software (ISO 26262, MISRA).

ðŸš€ I am actively expanding my expertise in Robotics, Autonomous Driving, and Embedded AI. To apply these skills, I am developing open-source projects in ROS 2 (TF, URDF, SLAM, Nav2), Computer Vision (OpenCV), and Deep Learning (CNNs, DNNs) â€” all available here on GitHub.

ðŸ“Œ My long-term goal is to drive innovation at the intersection of Automotive, Robotics, and AI-powered Embedded Systems.
