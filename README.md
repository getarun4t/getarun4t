üöÄ Embedded ECU & Perception Engineer | SDV | Robotics | AI Vision | C++ | Python | ROS 2 | AUTOSAR

I‚Äôm an Embedded ECU & Perception Engineer driving innovation at the intersection of Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), AI-based vision systems, and robotic validation automation. With 11+ years in automotive embedded engineering, I specialize in merging embedded control logic with AI-driven perception to build intelligent, self-validating automotive systems.

Currently, I deliver production-grade ECU features for the Porsche PPE SDV platform, integrating Adaptive AUTOSAR, Modern C++ (C++17), CAN/Ethernet (UDS, SOME/IP), and OTA diagnostics within ISO 26262 / ASPICE-compliant workflows.

üí° Alongside production work, I develop AI-powered robotics pipelines using TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and ROS 2 (MoveIt, TF, URDF) ‚Äî enabling autonomous HMI interaction and accelerating SDV/ADAS validation cycles by replacing manual dependency with perception-based automation.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Engineering Stack

ECU & SDV Software: AUTOSAR Adaptive | OTA/Diagnostics | SOME/IP | UDS | Embedded C++ | ISO 26262 | ASPICE

Perception AI: TensorFlow / Keras | CNN / DNN Inference | OpenCV Vision Pipelines | Edge AI Integration

Robotics & Automation: ROS 2 | MoveIt | HMI Automation | AI-driven Validation | Continuous HIL Testing

DevOps & CI/CD: Jenkins | GitHub Actions | GTest / PyTest | Automated ECU Validation Pipelines

üå± Passion & Goals

I‚Äôm passionate about creating embedded systems that see, decide, and act ‚Äî fusing perception, autonomy, and embedded intelligence to redefine how vehicles are built and validated.

Here on GitHub, I share open-source projects exploring:

ROS 2 robotics frameworks (TF, URDF, Nav2)

Computer vision & deep learning (CNNs, DNNs)

ü§ù Open To

üìå Collaborating with OEM innovation teams, SDV/ADAS R&D units, and robotics‚Äìperception teams/engineers shaping the next generation of autonomous automotive systems.
